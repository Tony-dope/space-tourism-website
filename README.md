# Frontend Mentor - Space tourism website

## hello everyone welcome to my readme for the space tourism website by frontend mentor. You can feel free to browse through the code and also preview the website🤸🏼‍♂️... 



## The challenge i experienced
   if you have gone through the website preview, in the homepage you would have noticed that on the second column that has the EXPLORE sign on it, it was not really appealing to the eye. please anyone that has any idea on how i can fix that should pls help me, i will be grateful.
    -Secondly i had an issue with the background image responsiveness, so i just had to use only the desktop background image for each of the different sections.
         I also could not really give a navigator ike in the design files, so i had to improvise😅  at the crew section.  The same applies for the technology section, although that one turned out ok but i am having issues with it's positioning to responsiveness.
   Any feedback will be appreciated...Thanks.
